Blockchains
A blockchain is a specialized network, which utilizes an open and decentralized database. It consists of three basic units: Accounts, Transactions, and Coins.

	The Account
	Accounts function in much the same way a traditional bank account do, allowing the owner to send and receive transactions.
	Each account has a unique address and a private key.

	The Transaction
	Transactions are digital messages, which transfer data between two accounts on the network. 
	They contain the addresses of both the senders' and the receivers' accounts, along with additional data.
	The transaction has a public key. The public let to check that the transaction comes from the right Account

	The Coin
	Coins are the fundamental unit of value used on a blockchain. 
	Users provide processing power to run the network, through what is known as mining, and are awarded coins in exchange.
	Coins are a digital store of value analogous to how USD or RMB are physical stores of value.
	Coins have an intrinsic economic value as they are a representation of resources spent (electricity, computing power, etc.) in order to run the blockchain's network.
	Examples include Ethereum and Bitcoin.
	
Cryptocurrency
A primary application of the blockchain is as currency. There exist two types of cryptocurrency: Coins and Tokens.

	Tokens
	Tokens function as currency in the sense that they are transferable between different accounts.
	They do not have an intrinsic economic value in the way that coins do, as the creation of tokens is not done by the blockchain itself, but rather through specialized transactions.
	Examples include OMG, BAT, and AMB.
	
ledge: distribute unit that contains a transaction.
